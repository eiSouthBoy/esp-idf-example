            Enable resolving test services on startup.
            These services are advertized and evaluated in automated tests.
            When executed locally, these will not be resolved and warnings appear in the log.
            Please set to false to disable initial querying to avoid warnings.

        help
            If enabled, we try to add a custom netif to mdns service.
            Note that for using with common connection example code, we have to disable
            all predefined interfaces in mdns component setup (since we're adding one
            of the default interfaces)
